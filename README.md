# ucfclubhub
Project from last semester where I did some very interesting developing, using a web scraping spider(webscraper.io) to scrape club information of more than 500 clubs, within minutes. After seeing the spider map and linking the information to the important style tags in the page that held the information and drawing the map for it , I then took the csv file off the google chrome developer window and inserted it directly into a mysql database. which was then redisplayed using, php, and an ajax powered load more button.  I also created an interesting search feature which searched the database for like terms of the requested query.
